# Gene Similarity Search
Projects developed during the Spring 2017 Advanced Database course at Boston University.

* Designed an application to search the best match gene sequences in a gene database.
* Implemented BoostMap training algorithm with AdaBoost in python for data training.
* Speeds up the retrieval and classification by 30% using embedding-based nearest neighbor retrieval with computationally expensive distance measures.
